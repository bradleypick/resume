\end{itemize}

\vspace{2pt}

\subsection{Notable Projects}

\vspace{5pt}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\textbf{Masters Capstone Project (Ongoing):} '\textit{Read by QxMD Collections Recommendations}'

\vspace{3pt}

\small{This project involves a team of graduate students building a recommendation engine 
for the \textit{Read} by QxMD application. It involves close collaboration with QxMD identifying 
their business objectives and discovering how data science can be used to achieve said 
objectives. Specifically my roles include developing certain sub-modules of the deliverable 
Python package(s), reading research papers to identify particularly pertinent machine learning models, and maintaining the development environment/Docker containers. 
Furthermore, the project includes the development of a pipeline that ingests data from 
a production database and yields recommendations in batches.}}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{\textbf{Extracurricular Project (Ongoing):} '\textit{\href{https://github.com/UBC-CS/lipo-python}{Implementing Global optimization of Lipschitz functions}}'

\vspace{3pt}

\small{This additional project involves the implementation of a global optimization technique 
called LIPO from the paper 'Global optimization of Lipschitz Functions' by CÃ©dric Malherbe, Nicolas Vayatis. The main goals include replication of the original results and further 
numerical experimentation. It involves significant exposure to scientific
computing (in general and specifically in Python) and optimization.}}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{\textbf{DSCI 532 Data Visualization II Final Project:} '\textit{\href{https://github.com/bradleypick/food-expenditure}{Canadian Food Expenditure Shiny App}}'

\vspace{3pt}

\small{This course project involved the development of an R shiny application displaying data 
collected by Statistics Canada pertaining to household expenditure on food. Particular 
attention was paid to correct use of the underlying theory of data visualization. This 
was done with the end goal of ease of use and understanding for the consumer.}}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{\textbf{DSCI 522 - Data Science Workflows Final Project:}'\textit{\href{https://github.com/bradleypick/BC-motor-vehicle-incidents}{BC Motor Vehicle Incident Analysis}}'

\vspace{3pt}

\small{This course project involved the development of a simple analysis of data on motor 
vehicle incidents in British Columbia. The data source was the Government of BC data catalogue.
Particular attention was paid to dependency management and reproducibility. 
Specific tools used include packrat for R package management, Make for simple building, and 
Docker for containerization.}}

\end{itemize}

\section{Previous Employment}

\vspace{6pt}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\cventry{2015-2017}{Quality Control Technician/Labourer}{\textsc{Dawson Construction}}{Various Locations in BC}{}{\vspace{3pt}
As a quality control technician I worked on site to ensure the various elements of 
the construction project were carried out in accordance with Dawson's Quality Control plan.
This included density testing, surveying, and the associated documentation.
