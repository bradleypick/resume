\subsection{Notable Projects}

\vspace{5pt}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\textbf{Masters Capstone Project (Ongoing):} \textit{Collections Recommendations with QxMD}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{Part of a team of graduate students building a recommendation engine 
for the \textit{Read} app by \Colorhref{https://qxmd.com/}{QxMD}. The project involves identifying business objectives, reading research papers to identify particularly pertinent machine learning models, applying machine learning to build a recommender system, and maintaining the Python development environment/Docker containers.}}

\item{\textbf{Extracurricular Project (Ongoing):} \textit{\Colorhref{https://github.com/UBC-CS/lipo-python}{Implementing Global optimization of Lipschitz functions}}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{Implementing a global optimization technique 
called LIPO from the paper \textit{Global optimization of Lipschitz Functions} (published in ICML 2017). The main goals are replication of the original results and further 
numerical experimentation. The project involves significant exposure to optimization and scientific computing in Python.}}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{\textbf{DSCI 532 (Data Visualization II) Final Project:} \textit{\Colorhref{https://github.com/bradleypick/food-expenditure}{Canadian Food Expenditure Shiny App}}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{Developed an R Shiny application displaying data 
collected by Statistics Canada pertaining to household expenditure on food. Particular 
attention was paid to correct use of the underlying theory of data visualization to promote ease of use.}}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{\textbf{DSCI 522 (Data Science Workflows) Final Project:}\textit{\Colorhref{https://github.com/bradleypick/BC-motor-vehicle-incidents}{BC Motor Vehicle Incident Analysis}}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{Developed a simple data analysis pipeline on motor 
vehicle incidents in British Columbia. The data source was the Government of BC data catalogue.
Particular attention was paid to dependency management and reproducibility. 
Specific tools used include \texttt{packrat} for R package management, \texttt{Make} for simple building, and 
Docker for containerization.}}
